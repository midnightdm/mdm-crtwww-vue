      <h2>Welcome River Fans!</h2>
        <p>This website is for river fans and barge tow spotters of the Clinton, Iowa area. It works by collecting MMSI transponder data sent via a radio device on equipped vessels using a radio receiver and a computer. The information is then parsed and saved to a database for display on these pages. Presently each vessel's location is plotted on a <a href="https://maps.google.com">Google Map</a> while other information is shown along side. Anyone who likes to watch vessels can use the site to figure when one will soon be close to them.</p>
        <h2>Fully Implemented</h2>
        <p>All features envisioned for this site are now complete including boat-shaped map icons that rotate with vessel heading updates and text descriptions of vessel locations on the data tiles.We've also solved a software crashing problem that had limited refreshes to once per minute. Now they happen 3 times per minute which is the same frequency as vessels actually send out their data updates.</p>
        <p>If you play around on the Live page you'll find several interactive featues. Pressing the vessel name on its tile expands the tile to show more data. When you then click its position coordinates the map will zoom into that vessel's location. Click the red highlighted coordinates again to return the Clinton centered map. A button below the tiles will toggle on the mile marker tags. Markers show as green lines all the time.</p>
        <p>  
        Another feature allows users to subscribe to push notifications to receive notices when vessels are nearing Clinton for viewing. There are two groups with different notice frequency.  The Passenger Vessels group will give you five notices for each vessel, but such vessels arrive only a few times per month. The All Vessels group gives only two alerts per vessel, but there are many vessels each day. There is no cost for the service and it requires giving no personal data. Activate it and get more details on the Alerts page. If you accidentally choose the wrong list, delete this site from your web browser's notification settings, then read the correct one.</p>
